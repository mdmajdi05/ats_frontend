  {
    question: 'What paperwork comes with your parts?',
    answer:
      'Every part ships with AS9100 and AS9120 documentation, plus manufacturer certificates and material traceability. We share all of this with your quote, not after you have already paid.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How fast can you get me a quote?',
    answer:
      'Most requests get a response within 24 hours. If you have an unplanned outage, let us know and we will try to turn it around the same day.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you ship outside the US?',
    answer:
      'Yes, we ship to over 150 countries. We handle the export paperwork for turbine and control system components, including items with dual-use restrictions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is a CAGE code and why does it matter?',
    answer:
      'It is a unique ID for the manufacturer or supplier of a part, used in defense and government procurement. For turbine buyers, it confirms you are getting the part from the company that actually made it, not a lookalike from some unverified source.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you stop counterfeit parts?',
    answer:
      'Every part goes through inspection and documentation checks before it ships. If we cannot verify where a part came from, we do not stock it, no matter how badly someone needs it.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you find obsolete or discontinued parts?',
    answer:
      'That is actually where we do our best work. Legacy Mark V control cards, discontinued combustion hardware, older Speedtronic components. Our network of 1,200 suppliers means we can often find parts that other distributors have given up on.',
